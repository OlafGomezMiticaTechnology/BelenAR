  AngelTexts:
  - "Now there were shepherds in that region living in the fields and keeping the
    night watch over their flock.\nThe angel of the Lord appeared to them and the
    glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were struck with great fear.\nThe
    angel said to them, \"Do not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news
    of great joy that will be for all the people. \nFor today in the city of David
    a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord.\nAnd this will be a sign
    for you: you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a
    manger.\"And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel,
    praising God and saying:\n\"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to
    those on whom his favor rests.\""
  - "When the angels went away from them to heaven, the shepherds said to one another,
    \"Let us go, then, to Bethlehem to see this thing that has taken place, which
    the Lord has made known to us.\" \nSo they went in haste and found Mary and Joseph,
    and the infant lying in the manger."
  - When they saw this, they made known the message that had been told them about
    this child. All who heard it were amazed by what had been told them by the shepherds.

  - 'When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold,
    magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, "Where is the newborn king of
    the Jews? We saw his star at its rising and have come to do him homage."When
    King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. Assembling
    all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where
    the Messiah was to be born. They said to him,

    In Bethlehem of Judea, for
    thus it has been written through the prophet:

    "And you, Bethlehem, land
    of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; since from you shall
    come a ruler, who is to shepherd my people Israel."'
  - 'He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the child.
    When you have found him, bring me word, that I too may go and do him homage."After
    their audience with the king they set out. And behold, the star that they had
    seen at its rising preceded them, until it came and stopped over the place where
    the child was.

    They were overjoyed at seeing the star, and on entering the
    house they saw the child with Mary his mother.They prostrated themselves and
    did him homage.Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold,
    frankincense, and myrrh.'

    their country by another way.\n BIBLE / The Gospels / MATTHEW / Chapter 2, 1

    This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius

    So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town.

    And
    Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, to the city
    of David that is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of
    David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.

    While
    they were there, the time came for her to have her child,and she gave birth to
    her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger,
    because there was no room for them in the inn.
